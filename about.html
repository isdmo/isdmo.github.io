<h2 class="section-heading">Welcome to Our Website and our FOUNDATION
</h2>

<p>As part of the Intelligent Science and Design Organization (ISDO), we believe that science is translated though culture and culture is translated though art. The way from science to society, thus, passes culture and art. Indeed, the three angles of Science, Culture and Art are fundamental components of society, and together they form a whole.
