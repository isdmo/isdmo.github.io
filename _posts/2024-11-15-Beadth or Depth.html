<p>One of the experiences I’ve gained throughout my projects is observing the constant battle between "breadth" and "depth." The battle between focusing on one subject to learn it thoroughly or having basic knowledge across various topics. 
</p>

<p>If you ask me which is better, I’d say both. You might think that’s an impossible answer, but I'll explain how it's actually achievable. 
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Depth Matters</h2>

<p>Depth represents mastery of a subject. It comes from extensive study, categorizing findings, and finally reflecting and documenting the information. It doesn’t matter if you're working on a well-known topic or a new method, but it’s essential to keep the subject always in view. 
</p>

<p>This deep experience gives you skills that help you tackle the next subject faster and better. For example, my years of experience with the minor topic of poly(A) tail of mRNA helped me complete my next project on protein biochemistry much faster. Though working on poly(A) as a minor project may not seem worthy of such depth at first glance, it had invaluable benefits. I learned skills like searching and understanding articles, categorizing information, scientific writing, and research methods which I used in all subsequent projects. 
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Breadth Also Matters</h2>

<p>Now, about breadth! By breadth, I mean having knowledge across different topics. Even if you're working on a specific protein, you might simultaneously study areas like evolution, ecology, or neuroscience. This is what I call breadth. 
</p>

<p>Breadth helps you not only apply insights from one area to another but also come up with unique breakthroughs by combining different insights. For example, I worked on proteins and genome editing, while also studying cellular signaling. 
</p>

<p>Combining these led me to develop a genome-editing method that can record cell signaling, a technique that could revolutionize cell biology!
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Seeking Both</h2>

<p>In my opinion, a student needs both. If you're doing a project on a specific signaling pathway, also study the structure of the proteins involved in that pathway. Read about methods to analyze signaling at different levels: genome, transcripts, or proteins. While focused on your signaling pathway, also explore related pathways. Understand how they coordinate to make crucial cellular decisions. Try to come up with ideas that merge your findings. 
</p>

<p>Even, study the history of these proteins and their other roles in the cell and look into how their gene expression is regulated. In short, focus primarily on your project, but also dive into protein structure, gene regulation, new tools, and cellular interactions. 
</p>

<p>Even reading a sociology book might help!
